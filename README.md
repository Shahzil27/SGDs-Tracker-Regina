# Project Idea
Create a website that monitors Regina's locally set sustainable development goals, quantifying and tracking progress.

# Project background & Business Opportunity
The time for deliverable nears with respect to the global initiative to attain our set global sustainable development goals. Some communities have, therefore, built themself a way of tracking their local efforts and progress. There exists now a need and an opportunity for Regina to have our own SDG monitoring system to track local set SDGs, quantifying them. This will work to consolidate future mission related investments and seed community growth.
